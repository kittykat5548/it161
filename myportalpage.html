<p><i>Hi my name is Talana,</i>  I am taking this class because I want to design safe web platforms for children.
as well as would love to design video games for people with disabilatys such as <strong>Autism, Asperger's, exd.</strong>
I have taken a it100 before, I hapen to be extreamly well with electronics and a very quick study. I love to play video game, 
as well as do lots of art.
</p>
<p>Although I do have to say that I love my art. That all being said I am doing all of this because of my kids.
I want to do something that I love doing as well as something that my kids can be proud of. I love my kids with all my heart.
When I started going to to school to get a dagree in both web and garphic design, so that I could make a safe platform for my children.
To tell the truth my children have always been my main reason for doing things to better this world for them.
</p>
